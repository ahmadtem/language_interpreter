# language_interpreter
The goal of this project is to understand and build an interpreter in three languages (Python, SML, Java) for a small language. The interpreter will read from an input file (input.txt) which contains lines of expressions, evaluates them and pushes the results onto a stack. It then prints the content of the stack to an output file (output.txt) and finally exits.

Please refer to HW4.pdf for a detailed description of the project.
